# weather-quotes
This is a Web application which I have made while learning nodejs to get a hands-on experience. In this project you can check weather as well as positive quotes and tweet it in your twitter account.

This web-app have three routes home, weather and quotes.

In home page I have given a brief idea of project. In weather page you can check weather of any city by entering city name. I have implemented it with the help of openweathermap api. In quotes page you can check positive quotes and their author also. And you can tweet your favourite one in twitter by just clicking a button.
